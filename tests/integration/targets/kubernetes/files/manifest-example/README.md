# MANIFEST.json README

This manifest file is used in the test environment to overcome a bug currently in Ansible core: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/67399

Once that bug is fixed, this file can be removed, along with the `cp` command used in the CI GitHub Actions workflow for this repository.
